# Wasteland
The final project for CS210 (Algorithms and Data Structures 1) in the 2nd year of the course was to develop a game. We were pretty much given free reign and I came up with and developed "Wasteland". A survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world where the player needs to make it to the safe-zone. Each day you encounter a new challenge and you must manage your health, hunger, thirst and items, while making the correct choices. Each choice influences the next

This is a console-based game and, as of right now, has no other UI.
